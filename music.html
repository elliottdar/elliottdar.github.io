					<h3>Flute</h3>
					<p>
						The flute is the first instrument I picked up, I starting playing it when I was around 7 so I've
						been playing it for about 15 years now and I had lessons for about 8 years. It's the instrument I 
						can do the most technical stuff on.

					<h3>Piano</h3>
					<p>
						Next was the piano, I didn't have any lessons for this one, I just learned by reading music sheets 
						that my mother would leave on the piano. To this day I still do that, find a random sheet online, 
						try to play it and see how it goes.

					<h3>Guitar</h3>
					<p>
						I started playing guitar when I was 14, I went to a music summer camp and that's where I learned 
						the basics of guitar. Now I have a guitar at home and like for piano, I just look for sheets online 
						and try to play them as best as I can.
					</p>

				<div id="cello">

					<h3>Cello</h3>
					<p>
						The cello is one of the last instruments I started playing and it's also definitely the one I'm the 
						worst at. I was around 16 when I started to take lessons but I stopped taking the lessons 2 years 
						later and since I don't have a cello at home, I can't really practice now but when I find a way to 
						get my own cello, I'll get back to it and try to get better !
