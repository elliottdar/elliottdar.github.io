					Hi ! I'm Elliott, I'm non-binary and I use they/them pronouns.
					<br>I'm not new to programming and web development since I followed a course at MolenGeek and I also attended 
					School 19 (also located in BeCentral) so I'm really happy to come back to BeCentral and learn more.
					<br>I can't wait to meet you all and get to know you, see you on Monday !

					<h3>Music</h3>
					<p>I've played music all my life I play multiple instruments like the flute, guitar, piano and cello.<br>
						You'll also rarely spot me without my headphones, I bring them everywhere I go.
						Fun fact, I have the biggest 'Liked songs' playlist out of all my friends, there's over 5000 songs in 
						there ranging from Classical to Metal. But don't try to ask me what my favorite song is, 
						there's just too much, I can't choose.<br>
						Want to know more ? Click <a href="./music.html">here</a> !

				<div id="games">
					<h3>Games</h3>
					<p>
						I play a lot of games, solo or with my friends. Growing up I never really played a lot of games though, 
						I started playing games when I was around 17 so I'm usually not very good but I have fun so that's all 
						that matters. The game me and my friends have been playing the most lately is Valorant which is my 
						first fps game so yeah don't trust my aim.
